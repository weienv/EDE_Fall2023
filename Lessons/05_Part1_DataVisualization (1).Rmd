## Objectives
1. Perform simple data visualizations in the R package `ggplot`
2. Develop skills to adjust aesthetics and layers in graphs
3. Apply a decision tree framework for appropriate graphing methods

## Opening discussion
Effective data visualization depends on purposeful choices about graph types. The ideal graph type depends on the type of data and the message the visualizer desires to communicate. The best visualizations are clear and simple. A good resource for data visualization is [Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/), which includes both a decision tree for visualization types and explanation pages for each type of data, including links to R resources to create them. Take a few minutes to explore this website.

## Set Up

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse);library(lubridate);library(here)
install.packages("ggridges")
library(ggridges)

here()

PeterPaul.chem.nutrients <- 
  read.csv(here("Data/Processed/NTL-LTER_Lake_Chemistry_Nutrients_PeterPaul_Processed.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered <-
  read.csv(here("Data/Processed/NTL-LTER_Lake_Nutrients_PeterPaulGathered_Processed.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
EPAair <- read.csv(here("Data/Processed/EPAair_O3_PM25_NC1819_Processed.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

EPAair$Date <- ymd(EPAair$Date)
PeterPaul.chem.nutrients$sampledate <- ymd(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients$sampledate)
PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered$sampledate <- ymd(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered$sampledate)

```

## ggplot

ggplot, called from the package `ggplot2`, is a graphing and image generation tool in R. This package is part of tidyverse. While base R has graphing capabilities, ggplot has the capacity for a wider range and more sophisticated options for graphing. 
ggplot has only a few rules: 

* The first line of ggplot code always starts with `ggplot()`
* A data frame must be specified within the `ggplot()` function. Additional datasets can be specified in subsequent layers.
* Aesthetics must be specified, most commonly x and y variables but including others. Aesthetics can be specified in the `ggplot()` function or in subsequent layers.
* Additional layers must be specified to fill the plot. 

### Geoms

Here are some commonly used layers for plotting in ggplot: 

* geom_bar
* geom_histogram
* geom_freqpoly
* geom_boxplot
* geom_violin
* geom_dotplot
* geom_density_ridges
* geom_point
* geom_errorbar
* geom_smooth
* geom_line
* geom_area
* geom_abline (plus geom_hline and geom_vline) #intersects a and b
* geom_text

### Aesthetics
Here are some commonly used aesthetic types that can be manipulated in ggplot: 

* color
* fill
* shape
* size
* transparency

### Plotting continuous variables over time: Scatterplot and Line Plot

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4, warning = FALSE}
# Scatterplot
ggplot(EPAair, aes(x = Date, y = Ozone)) + 
  geom_point()
#aes can be specified inside of ggplot() or in geom_point()
O3plot <- ggplot(EPAair) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Date, y = Ozone))
##useful when we want to have several plots together
print(O3plot)

# Fix this code
O3plot2 <- ggplot(EPAair) +
  ##geom_point(aes(x = Date, y = Ozone, color = "blue")) ###when we do this, we are adding another layer to the plot
  geom_point(aes(x = Date, y = Ozone), color = "blue") ###we need to specify the color outside of aes
print(O3plot2)

# Add additional variables
# How could you automatically assign a marker color to a variable? 
PMplot <- 
  ggplot(EPAair, aes(x = Month, y = PM2.5, shape = as.factor(Year), color = Site.Name)) +
  geom_point() ##assign shapes depending on the year
print(PMplot)

# Separate plot with facets
PMplot.faceted <-
  ggplot(EPAair, aes(x = Month, y = PM2.5, shape = as.factor(Year))) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(Site.Name), nrow = 3) ###facet_wrap: creating different plots for different sites, 3 rows
print(PMplot.faceted)

 # Filter dataset within plot building and facet by multiple variables
PMplot.faceted2 <- 
  ggplot(subset(EPAair, Site.Name == "Clemmons Middle" | Site.Name == "Leggett" |
                  Site.Name == "Bryson City"), ###only include those three sites
         aes(x = Month, y = PM2.5)) + 
  geom_point() 
  facet_grid(Site.Name ~ Year) ###column: year, rows:site name
print(PMplot.faceted2)

# Plot true time series with geom_line
PMplot.line <- 
  ggplot(subset(EPAair, Site.Name == "Leggett"), 
         aes(x = Date, y = PM2.5)) +
  geom_line()
print(PMplot.line)
##time series plot

```


### Plotting the relationship between two continuous variables: Scatterplot

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4, warning = FALSE}
# Scatterplot
lightvsDO <- 
  ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients, aes(x = irradianceWater, y = dissolvedOxygen)) + ##visualizing 2 vairables n finding relationship between them
  geom_point()
print(lightvsDO) ##too far from each other

# Adjust axes
lightvsDOfixed <- 
  ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients, aes(x = irradianceWater, y = dissolvedOxygen)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(0, 250) +
  ylim(0, 20)
print(lightvsDOfixed)

# Depth in the fields of limnology and oceanography is on a reverse scale
tempvsdepth <- 
  ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients, aes(x = temperature_C, y = depth)) +
  #ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients, aes(x = temperature_C, y = depth, color = daynum)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_reverse() ###reversing the y axis
print(tempvsdepth)

NvsP <-
  ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients, aes(x = tp_ug, y = tn_ug, color = depth)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) + ###trendline: linear
  geom_abline(aes(slope = 16, intercept = 0)) #intercept: the x value it intercepts
print(NvsP)

```

### Plotting continuous vs. categorical variables
A traditional way to display summary statistics of continuous variables is a bar plot with error bars. Let's explore why this might not be the most effective way to display this type of data. Navigate to the Caveats page on Data to Viz (https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html) and find the page that explores barplots and error bars. 

What might be more effective ways to display the information? Navigate to the boxplots page in the Caveats section to explore further.

```{r, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 4, warning = FALSE}
# Box and whiskers plot
Nutrientplot3 <-
  ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered, aes(x = lakename, y = concentration)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(color = nutrient)) # Why didn't we use "fill"? ##fill is the filling of the boxplot, whereas color changes the lines of the boxplots and the outlier dots
print(Nutrientplot3)

# Dot plot
Nutrientplot4 <-
  ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered, aes(x = lakename, y = concentration)) +
  geom_dotplot(aes(color = nutrient, fill = nutrient), binaxis = "y", binwidth = 1, 
               stackdir = "center", position = "dodge", dotsize = 2) #
print(Nutrientplot4)
####better representation of the data
##binaxis: stacking the observations over y
#### stackdir: where to stack the points
#### position: dodge: so that the dots do not overlay, they go to the side (hence horizontal "lines" in some plots)

# Violin plot ###also shows density plot in addition to summary stats that boxplots provide
Nutrientplot5 <-
  ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered, aes(x = lakename, y = concentration)) +
  geom_violin(aes(color = nutrient)) #
print(Nutrientplot5)

# Frequency polygons
# Using a tidy dataset
Nutrientplot6 <- ######not a good way to do this
  ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = tn_ug), color = "darkred") +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = tp_ug), color = "darkblue") +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = nh34), color = "blue") +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = no23), color = "royalblue") +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = po4), color = "red") 
print(Nutrientplot6)

# Using a gathered dataset ###gathered has all the nutrients in one column and conc in antoher: longer 
Nutrientplot7 <-   
  ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = concentration, color = nutrient))
print(Nutrientplot7)

# Frequency polygons have the risk of becoming spaghetti plots. 
# See <https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/spaghetti.html> for more info.

# Ridgeline plot
Nutrientplot6 <-
  ggplot(PeterPaul.chem.nutrients.gathered, aes(y = nutrient, x = concentration)) +
  geom_density_ridges(aes(fill = lakename), alpha = 0.5) #
print(Nutrientplot6) ###fill: fil below the curve


```
